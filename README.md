# CodeDebtTracker
Code Debt Tracker is a fun accountability platform built with Angular + Firebase to help you and your friends stay consistent by solving at least one HackerRank problem a day. If you miss a day, you owe a small penalty fee. At the end of the month, everyone settles their "code debt" â€” encouraging both consistency and responsibility.
